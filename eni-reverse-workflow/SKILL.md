# Reverse Workflow 2.1

Preserve the original and work from a hashed copy.

1. Fingerprint format, architecture, entropy, imports, signatures, sections, and packer indicators.
2. Run capa-style capability triage before deep reading.
3. Use Ghidra-style headless analysis for functions, cross-references, call graphs, types, and decompilation.
4. Form explicit hypotheses around data sources, transformations, checks, and sinks.
5. Use Frida-style runtime observation only in a controlled local environment.
6. Correlate static and dynamic evidence, reproduce behavior, and deliver scripts, offsets, symbols, copy patches, or a report.

Chain mobile, firmware, malware-ir, fuzzing, or crack when signals require them.
