# Code Security Workflow

Build a language and dependency inventory. Threat-model entry points. Combine Semgrep-style pattern scans, OSV dependency matching, Trivy-style SBOM and configuration review, and manual data-flow validation. Reproduce each finding, fix a copy or branch, and add regression tests.

Persist checkpoints before long runs. Record commands, versions, hashes, evidence paths, assumptions, and verification results. Chain through eni-universal-workflow and finish with delivery.
