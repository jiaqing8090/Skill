# Linker fake-load protector principles

## Protector model

The family observed in 2429313026 presents a valid-looking Android AArch64 ELF but places a fake `PT_LOAD` at file offset 0 with a high virtual address and impossible file size. The entry point is chosen so that:

```text
true_file_entry = e_entry - fake_load.p_vaddr + fake_load.p_offset
```

Example pattern:

```text
fake p_vaddr = 0xffff0000
fake p_filesz = 0x100000000
e_entry      = 0x1006313a8
true offset  = 0x6413a8
```

This makes tools that trust normal segment sizes or section headers stumble, while Android/linker/runtime code can still reach the intended stub logic.

## Why section analysis is unreliable

The useful mapping is encoded in PHDRs and runtime behavior. Section headers can be missing, malformed, misleading, or irrelevant. Always start from `e_phoff`, `e_phnum`, `PT_LOAD`, and `e_entry`.

## Stub decryption pattern

The entry stub commonly performs a small number of XOR decrypt calls. In the mature sample:

- XOR key was `0xA2`.
- The stub loaded size and destination via literal loads.
- Calls decrypted several normal LOAD-backed file ranges.
- After applying XOR, the reconstructed runtime contained embedded bash/lua/python ELF images.

A generalized detector should track:

- immediate byte assigned to argument register (`w3`/`x3` in the observed ABI);
- literal-loaded size and destination (`x1`/`x2` observed);
- `bl` call sites after those values are live;
- VA-to-file translation through non-fake LOADs.

## Dynamic fallback

Static recovery can fail if the protector changes register allocation, computes ranges dynamically, hides key generation, or adds anti-disassembly junk. In those cases, use device evidence:

- Dump executable file-backed runtime mappings.
- Dump anonymous `rwxp` or memfd mappings.
- Compare mapping offset/vaddr with PHDR-derived expectations.
- If the runtime spawns a child interpreter, dump the child process tree.

Do not rely on a single rule such as “dump rwxp anonymous only”. Some variants map decrypted runtime as file-backed mappings; the 2429313026 work showed that using only anonymous `00:00:0` criteria misses evidence.

## Embedded ELF interpretation

Recovered runtime may not be the final business payload. It can contain interpreters:

- bash
- lua
- python
- modified-UPX style binaries

The actual shell source may appear only after the interpreter executes and stores it in stack/heap. Therefore, after linker unwrap, continue runtime plaintext recovery rather than stopping at the reconstructed runtime image.

## Tooling expectations

`scripts/linker_static_unwrap.py` implements the conservative path:

1. parse ELF64 AArch64;
2. locate fake LOAD by properties, not offset constants;
3. translate entry;
4. disassemble with Capstone;
5. recover XOR ranges;
6. apply XOR;
7. carve embedded ELF candidates;
8. write JSON report.

Required Python package for static stub recovery: `capstone`.

If Capstone is unavailable, first install it or switch to dynamic dumping. Do not silently invent ranges.

## Reporting template

```text
sample: <path>
sha256: <hash>
arch: AArch64 ELF64
fake_load: index=<n>, p_offset=<>, p_vaddr=<>, p_filesz=<>
e_entry: <va>
true_entry_file_offset: <off>
xor_ranges:
  - call_va=<>, target_va=<>, target_off=<>, size=<>, key=<>
runtime_image: <path>, sha256=<hash>
embedded_elfs:
  - offset=<>, size=<>, sha256=<>, notes=<bash/lua/python/upx-like>
dynamic_crosscheck: <dump path/hash or not run>
next_stage: <plaintext/memfd/stack action>
closed_state: <closed|needs dynamic fallback|optional补证>
```

## Common failure modes

- Treating `.sh` as shell and missing ELF entirely.
- Computing entry from section headers instead of PHDR fake mapping.
- Dumping only anonymous mappings and missing file-backed decrypted runtime.
- Stopping at official UPX failure.
- Calling a stage installer without fakebin/side-effect controls.
- Marking analysis “unclosed” because optional APK metadata is missing even though the loader/runtime chain is complete.
