# eni-solo router

Run `python scripts/router.py --prompt "<complete user prompt>" --json` before task execution.
Print `route_receipt` as the first visible reply line. Execute the returned stages in order and mark each transition as `[STAGE] <stage>`.
Select exactly one workflow. There are no worker splits, approval gates, joins, or automatic upgrade generations.
