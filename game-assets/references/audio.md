# Audio

## Important guidance

- Keep most gameplay sound effects around one to two seconds; that duration covers most interaction, combat, and pickup needs.
- A 30-second music preview cannot be extended into the same three-minute track later. Every render is independent, so generate the three-minute version directly when the final deliverable needs full length.

## Purpose

Use this module to create gameplay sound effects, coherent effect packs, variations of one effect, music direction, or rendered game music.

| Capability | Command | Final role | Main limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Create sound effects | `sound-run` | Produce one effect, a coherent pack, or variants | Pack and variant modes are mutually exclusive |
| Draft or render music | `music-run` | Produce music direction or a playable track | Audio is rendered only when `--generate-audio` is selected |

Finalize gameplay timing, action, and loop intent before generating audio. Visual references may guide music mood, but they do not replace an explicit description of instrumentation, energy, and loop behavior.

## Sound effects

Create one sound:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py sound-run \
  --prompt "A short bright crystal pickup chime with a soft magical tail" \
  --duration 2 \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

Create a coherent pack:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py sound-run \
  --prompt "Wooden UI clicks for hover, confirm, cancel, locked, and error states" \
  --sound-pack \
  --count 5 \
  --duration 0.5 \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

Create variants of one sound with `--variants`. `--sound-pack` and `--variants` are mutually exclusive. Add `--loop` only when the final effect must loop continuously.

Duration may be 0.5 seconds or an integer from 1 through 10 seconds. Count applies only to packs or variants, may be from 1 through 10, and defaults to 4. Keep prompts concrete: source, material, action, intensity, perspective, ambience, tail, and loop requirement.

The skill never requests or accepts a third-party audio-service credential. Authentication and audio implementation remain server-managed.

## Music

Draft a music direction without rendering audio:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py music-run \
  --prompt "Warm pastoral exploration theme with wooden flute, pizzicato strings, and gentle hand percussion" \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

Render a track:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py music-run \
  --prompt "Tense clockwork boss theme with driving strings, metallic percussion, and a clear loop point" \
  --generate-audio \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

Use `--preview` only when the user explicitly wants a shorter review render. Repeat `--reference-image` when visual references should influence mood or instrumentation.

## Validate

- Confirm every audio file opens and has the expected duration.
- Listen for clipping, abrupt tails, unintended silence, and obvious seams.
- For loops, test the end-to-start transition in a repeating player.
- For packs, confirm each file is distinct and named or ordered consistently.
- Deliver only files listed in `final_outputs.json`.
