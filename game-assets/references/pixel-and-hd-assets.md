## Important guidance

### Eight-direction characters

- Control the source pose for the intended animation. For a walking animation, add this requirement or its exact meaning: `角色行走动作，迈开双腿，一前一后`.
- For a running animation, add this requirement or its exact meaning: `角色奔跑动作，迈开双腿，一前一后`.
- Confirm that the legs, silhouette, equipment, and anchor remain readable in every direction before starting animation.

### Background removal

- When the source is not on a white background and advanced removal is required, always describe exactly what must be preserved. Supplying that subject description makes the runner treat the source as non-white-background input, equivalent to setting the white-background option to false.
- Before advanced pixel-art background removal, ensure the source is already perfectly pixelated and preferably smaller than 512×512.
- Advanced removal disables its built-in perfect-pixel preprocessing. If the source still needs pixel cleanup, run standalone pixelation first, review that result, and only then remove the background. Perfect-pixel detection can fail on extremely simple or extremely complex images; combining both operations can waste the background-removal cost when preprocessing fails.

### Standalone pixelation

- Pixelate one object at a time whenever possible. A batch image, especially an AI-generated sheet, may contain different effective pixel sizes in different regions; one global pass can leave some objects sharp and others blurred.
- Do not repeat pixelation on Meowa-generated pixel assets. As a practical clue, assets smaller than 256×256 are usually already perfectly pixelated, although some Meowa tools intentionally produce larger pixel assets.
- Review every pixelation result. Very simple images, solid-color blocks, or highly abstract objects may be misread because their clusters are too large; extremely complex scenes and background maps may fail because their clusters are too small.

## Purpose

Use this module to create the base still asset for a character, prop, item, icon, or sprite pack, or to perform a visual-format operation such as multi-view generation, background removal, or pixel conversion.

| Capability | Command | Final role | Main limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Discover pixel or HD presets | `pixel-gen-template-info`, `hd-gen-template-info` | Choose a supported size, count, and asset family | Discovery does not generate an asset |
| Generate pixel or HD assets | `pixel-gen-run`, `hd-gen-run` | Produce the base still asset or pack | Preset size and count are fixed contracts |
| Generate unrestricted HD assets | `nano-banana-run`, `image-2-run` | Produce a scene, illustration, sprite sheet, or batch of assets | Prompt controls the arrangement; no preset asset contract |
| Discover large-pixel presets | `large-pixel-template-info` | Choose a supported large canvas shape | Lists only the large-pixel family |
| Generate a large pixel asset | `large-pixel-gen-run` | Produce a scene, illustration, portrait, building, or other large pixel composition | Requires a preset from large-pixel discovery |
| Generate a general-purpose 4:3 pixel image | `pixel-universal-gen-run` | Produce a normal-view or top-down pixel composition without choosing a preset | Uses the fixed large 4:3 canvas contract |
| Generate directional character views | `character-multi-view-run` | Produce an eight-direction character set | Requires a stable character reference |
| Remove a background | `remove-background-run` | Produce a transparent version of an existing asset | Edge quality depends on source complexity |
| Convert existing artwork to pixel art | `pixelate-run` | Produce a new pixel-style asset | Does not guarantee a hand-authored sprite or preset size |

Use a generated still asset as input to image editing, directional-view generation, sprite animation, or video only after its identity, scale, silhouette, and transparency are stable.

For pixel sprites, choose by production goal:

- Use preset-driven `pixel-gen-run` when exact dimensions or the highest available pixel quality matter.
- Use the general pixel canvas through `pixel-universal-gen-run` for low-cost, high-volume sprite batches and fast prototypes. Ask for a clearly spaced sprite sheet. Expect somewhat lower per-sprite fidelity and weaker exact-size control than preset-driven generation.

## Preset-driven generation

List presets before choosing one:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py pixel-gen-template-info
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py hd-gen-template-info
```

Create a pixel asset:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py pixel-gen-run \
  --template-name <preset> \
  --requirement "<asset description>" \
  --aspect-ratio 1:1 \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

Create an HD asset:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py hd-gen-run \
  --template-name <preset> \
  --requirement "<asset description>" \
  --resolution 2K \
  --aspect-ratio 1:1 \
  --quality detailed \
  --remove-bg-method standard \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

Use `--reference-file` for one reference and repeat `--reference-files` for additional references. Do not pass raw preset configuration JSON; choose a supported preset and product-level options. Preset discovery reports only product fields such as output size and default count. Treat those as fixed: if they do not match the request, choose another preset or report that the exact contract is unavailable.

Quality labels are:

| Command value | User-facing label |
|---|---|
| `standard` | Standard |
| `detailed` | Detailed |
| `ultimate` | Ultimate |

## General HD generation

Use Nano Banana for flexible composition, broad aspect-ratio support, and reference-guided generation:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py nano-banana-run \
  --prompt "A coherent HD fantasy item sheet with twelve clearly separated potions and scrolls" \
  --resolution 1K \
  --aspect-ratio 1:1 \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

Use Image-2 when its quality tiers and direct HD asset generation fit the task:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py image-2-run \
  --prompt "A clean HD game asset sheet with eight clearly separated sci-fi props" \
  --resolution 1K \
  --aspect-ratio 1:1 \
  --quality standard \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

- Default both commands to the shared 1K, 1:1 square working canvas. Treat it as the common 1024×1024-tier contract when moving a composition between Nano Banana and Image-2, and inspect the saved file for its actual delivered dimensions.
- Start Image-2 prompt iteration with `standard` (`Standard`), which is inexpensive. After the wording and composition are approved, rerun the same prompt with `detailed` (`Detailed`) for the production candidate. Use `ultimate` only when the final asset genuinely benefits from the additional quality and cost.
- Repeat `--reference-image` for up to eight visual references.
- Nano Banana supports 1K, 2K, and 4K plus its listed aspect ratios. Image-2 supports 1K and 2K with 1:1, 3:4, 4:3, 9:16, or 16:9.
- For batch generation, describe the asset count, shared style, spacing, background, and sheet arrangement. Review that every asset is complete and non-overlapping.
- Inspect for unintended labels or decorative lettering even when the prompt says `no text`; asset sheets can still introduce short item labels and may need regeneration or editing.
- Use `ui-gen-run` instead when the generated sheet also needs automatic background removal and component segmentation. That module is prompt-driven and can generate ordinary art assets or sprite sheets in addition to interface graphics.

## Large-pixel and Pixel Universal generation

Use the large-pixel preset family when a small exact-size character or prop preset does not provide enough canvas space:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py large-pixel-template-info

python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py large-pixel-gen-run \
  --template-name <large-pixel-preset> \
  --prompt "<scene, illustration, portrait, or large asset description>" \
  --reference-image <optional-style-reference.png> \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

- Select the preset from `large-pixel-template-info`; do not guess its name or expose internal configuration.
- Background removal defaults to `none` so complete scenes and illustrations remain intact. Use `standard` only when the desired final asset is an isolated subject on transparency.
- References may supply style, identity, layout, or source artwork. State what each reference should control in the prompt.

Use Pixel Universal Generation for a flexible 4:3 pixel composition without choosing a preset:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py pixel-universal-gen-run \
  --prompt "A top-down pixel-art market district with readable paths and compact stalls" \
  --view top-down \
  --reference-image <optional-reference.png> \
  --remove-bg-method none \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

Available views are:

| View | Use |
|---|---|
| `standard` | Normal composition for scenes, portraits, characters, buildings, and illustrations |
| `top-down` | Overhead game view for maps, rooms, environments, objects, and characters designed from above |

This is the pixel-art counterpart to a general Nano Banana-style image workflow. Suitable tasks include:

- Reinterpreting an HD reference as a new pixel-art composition.
- Generating a pixel scene, environment concept, character illustration, or portrait.
- Designing a building-upgrade progression or another multi-stage visual in one coherent composition.
- Creating top-down game assets while preserving an overhead camera convention.

The command fixes the large 4:3 canvas and defaults to keeping the background because most general compositions are complete scenes. Request standard background removal only for an isolated subject.

## Eight-direction characters

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py character-multi-view-run \
  --reference-image <character.png> \
  --mode pixel \
  --canvas-resolution 1K \
  --direction-mode mirror \
  --aspect-ratio 1:1 \
  --remove-bg-method standard \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

- Use `mirror` to generate five directions and mirror the compatible views into a complete eight-direction set.
- Use `ninegrid` to generate the eight directions in one nine-grid layout. It is a generation layout, not a nine-view deliverable.
- Pixel mode supports 1K or 2K. HD mode uses the service's fixed 2K canvas behavior even though the compatibility CLI still accepts `--canvas-resolution`.
- Use `--output-size` only when the requested final sprite size is explicit.
- Put pose, clothing, silhouette, or consistency requirements in `--extra-constraint`.

## Background removal

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py remove-background-run \
  --image-file <asset.png> \
  --mode pixel \
  --quality advanced \
  --prompt "Keep the armored character; remove the complex forest background" \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

- Choose `pixel` or `hd` to match the source artwork.
- Choose `standard` for a clean, simple background and `advanced` for difficult edges or a complex background.
- Add a subject prompt whenever an advanced-removal source is not white-backed or the background is complex.
- Do not name or select a background-removal provider.

## Pixel cleanup

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py pixelate-run \
  --image-file <source.png> \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

Use the generated file directly. For previews, enlarge only with nearest-neighbor sampling; never shrink a pixel asset merely to make it fit the response.

The public command always uses automatic pixel-size detection. Review the result before using it in production.

## Validate

- Confirm the final dimensions and aspect ratio.
- Confirm alpha transparency when requested.
- Inspect edges at an integer zoom with nearest-neighbor sampling.
- Check that sprite sheets contain complete, non-overlapping cells.
- Check `final_outputs.json` and deliver only the listed final media.
